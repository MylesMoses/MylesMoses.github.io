            <h3>Extinction</h3>
            <p>Non-avian dinosaurs became extinct after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, while avian dinosaurs mostly survived and evolved into modern-day birds.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
            <p>Avian dinosaurs had hollow bones to aid in flight, whereas non-avian dinosaurs had dense bones to support their weight.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Metabolic Processes</h3>
            <p>Non-avian dinosaurs were cold-blooded, unlike avian dinosaurs, which were warm-blooded and had different metabolic processes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Feathers and Flight</h3>
            <p>Avian dinosaurs, or birds, evolved from small, feathered theropod dinosaurs and are characterized by their feathers, which are used for insulation, display, and flight. Most non-avian dinosaurs did not have feathers and lacked the adaptations necessary for powered flight.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Brain Size and Behavior</h3>
            <p>Birds have relatively large brains compared to their body size, which is evident in their complex behaviors and intelligence. Non-avian dinosaurs had varying brain sizes, with some like Troodon having relatively large brains, while others had smaller brains relative to their body size.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Reproduction</h3>
            <p>Birds lay eggs and exhibit elaborate courtship displays, nest building, and parental care. Non-avian dinosaurs also laid eggs, but their reproductive behaviors likely differed, with some building nests and others possibly leaving their eggs unattended.</p>

          <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
          <p>Some theories suggest that avian dinosaurs survived due to their larger brains and varied diets compared to their non-avian counterparts.</p>
